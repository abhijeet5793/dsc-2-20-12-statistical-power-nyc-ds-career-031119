    "We've started to investigate hypothesis testing, p-values and their use for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis. Building upon this, we can develop a concept of the power of a statistical test, as the test's ability to detect a difference, when one exists. In the case of our coin flipping example, the power of our statistical test would be the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis \"this coin is fair\" when the coin was unfair. As you might assume, the power of this statistical test would thus depend on several factors including our p-value threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis, the size of our sample and the 'level of unfairness' of the coin in question.\n",

    "* Perform Power calculation using SciPy and Python\n",
    "* Demonstrate the impact of sample size on statistical power using simulations\n",
    "* Demonstrate the combined effect of sample size and effect size on statistical power using simulations  "

As with any probability, the power of a statistical test therefore ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being a perfect test that gaurantees rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed false."
